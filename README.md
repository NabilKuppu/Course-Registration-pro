<h1 align="center" id="title">Course-selling platform</h1>

<p id="description"><h2>Course Registration</h2> This is a course-selling platform built using React.js. <h3>Below are some of its key features:</h3> <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fully responsive Design.</li>
        <li>Prevents adding duplicate courses to the cart, providing a notification.</li>
        <li>Displays essential information:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Total credit hours</li>
            <li>Remaining credit hours</li>
            <li>Total price</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Alerts users if the entered credit hours are less than 0 or greater than 20.</li>
    </ul> How I manage the state in this project. In this project state management is handled in the `App` component. Events occur within the `Card` child component and data updates are reflected in the `cart` component. These two components are connected within the `App` component where the state is declared and data is passed to child components via props. - <h2>Three states are maintained: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Remaining Credit: <span id="remaining-credit">0</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Total Credit: <span id="total-credit">0</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Total Price: <span id="total-price">$0.00</span>
        </li>
    </ul></p>
